                            <h4>Governance, Risk Management and Compliance Management</h4>
                            <p>
                                Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) refer to a strategy for managing an
                                organisation's
                                overall governance, enterprise risk management, and compliance with regulations. It is a
                                structured approach to align IT with business objectives, while effectively managing
                                risk and
                                meeting compliance requirements. Having an effective GRC strategy is important because
                                it pulls
                                together the various risks, compliance, and governance functions in a complex
                                organization into
                                a single strategy.
                                <br><br>

                                An effective GRC strategy ensures that the organization is taking a comprehensive look
                                at risk
                                across the organization.A well-planned GRC strategy comes with lots of benefits and we,
                                at LS&CG
                                ensure that GRC is considered an important and viable asset so that we can provide the
                                best to
                                our partners.



                                We have an advanced GRC framework for bringing into action the right leadership and
                                organization
                                by enabling an IT system that supports and enable our strategic objectives. Our GRC plan
                                has
                                helps us and our partners by improving the performance and profit of the system as well
                                as by
                                devising a strong inter-organisational network to support business development.

                                We at LS&CG, with the right tactics, structure,6 and team in place, have devised a GRC
                                plan that
                                can save time and support your company in achieving business goals and in controlling

                            <h4>Business Risk Services Compliance</h4>
                            <p>
                                Regulatory initiatives such as an increased focus on management incentives for
                                fraudulent reporting and greater in-depth analysis of internal controls may provide a
                                viable foundation for reconsidering business risk methods and melding the best of
                                traditional substantive audits with the best of business risk auditing. BRA approach can
                                result in both risk‐adjusted and more efficiently produced audits.<br>

                                ​

                                Should the risk of litigation, sanctions, and impaired reputation affect the conduct of
                                an audit?<br>

                                ​

                                Audit risk is the probability that an auditor will issue an unqualified opinion on
                                materially

                                misstated financial statements.<br> <br>To overcome this issue,

                                we follow all the below mentioned approaches to conduct the audit- <br>

                                > The substantive procedures approach<br>

                                > The balance sheet Approach<br>

                                > The systems-based Approach<br>

                                > The risk-based Approach<br><br>

                                We here at LS&CG believe strongly that the latter is more representative of the manner
                                in which business risk audits were implemented.<br>
                                Internal auditing (IA) is an objective assurance and consulting activity designed not
                                only to add value to one’s business but also to improve an organisation’s various
                                operations. It can help an organization accomplish its strategic objectives by bringing
                                about systematic and disciplined approaches for evaluating and improving the
                                effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.</p>
